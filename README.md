# Personal_Website
My *old* personal website (andrewpuglionesi-old.appspot.com)  
This is a Django project containing a website that I started (long before the first commit) with basically no knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, and that I maintained regularly until making a new one in December 2018/January 2019. The new one is at www.andrewpuglionesi.com.
