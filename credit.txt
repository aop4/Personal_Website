This project was at some point migrated to be built on top of the Heroku Django Starter Template (https://github.com/heroku/heroku-django-template), available for use under the MIT license. I did it from scratch once, and once was enough. Thank you to the folks at Heroku (especially Kenneth Reitz, whom I've had the pleasure of corresponding with for other reasons; kennethreitz.org) for taking care of some of the dirty work and making it easier to deploy this Django app to Heroku.
